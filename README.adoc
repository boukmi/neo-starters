Spring Boot Neo Starters


## neo-starter-springmvc

Main starter for REST application development. It comprises of several
enhancements over plain Spring Boot defaults in areas such as: Jackson,
MVC, Handling Java 8 Date Time (JSR-310), etc.

###Class name aware request mapping

To avoid assigning same `@RequestMapping` on particular classes you can provide class name patterns
the mapping should follow. It is helpful when you want expose your business API with a given prefix.

To achieve that provide map property called `neostarter.mvc.classSuffixToPrefix`, where key is a class suffix
(case sensitive) and prefix which should be added to the mapped URL, ex:

[source,yml]
----
neostarter:
  mvc:
    class-suffix-to-prefix:
      Api: /api
----
